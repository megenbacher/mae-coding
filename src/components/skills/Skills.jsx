      <h2>My interest in web development began from my desire to 
              hone my creativity and see unique ideas come to life on the web.
              I also enjoy challenging myself by continuing to learn the ever evolving 
              programs and techniques required to code the most dynamic projects.</h2>

              <h2>When I'm not working on coding projects you can find me on the PNW hiking trails, 
              searching for the best cup of coffee or planning my next travel adventure.</h2>

              <h3>I can't wait to work with you!</h3>
